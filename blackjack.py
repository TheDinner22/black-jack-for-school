notes on project (in markdown format)

# starting the program

1. when the program is started, "START GAME #1" should be printed to the console
2. the player should automatically be dealt their first card

> each game should start with "START GAME #1" printed to the console 
> NOTE: adjust game number as needed

# how to "randomly " draw cards

1. Generate a number between 1 and 13 (inclusive)
2. there is a mapping between numbers and cards
    - 1 is an ace
    - 2-10 (inclusive) are the numbered cards
    - 11 is the jack
    - 12 is the queen
    - 13 is the king

# card point values

Same as in regular blackjack except that aces are only ever worth one point.

# announcing dealt cards WIP

Whenever a card is dealt, print the cards name and the total number of points in that players hand

For example, when delt a king the stdout would read: "Your card is a KING!"
For example, when delt a number card (2-10) with number, n, the stdout would read: "Your card is a n!"

# printing the menu after a card is dealt

todo!()
